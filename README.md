# ðŸŽ¬ 2022 Movies Table (JavaScript Callback Demo)
This is a simple front-end JavaScript project that demonstrates the use of callback functions with delayed execution. The core functionality revolves around clicking the title, which after a 3-second delay, reveals a list of 11 movies with their genres and release dates.


## ðŸ§© Features
- Click-based interaction on the table title
- 3-second delay before displaying content (simulating asynchronous behavior)
- Randomized or pre-defined movie data generation
- Minimal and clean separation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Great example for learning callbacks and dynamic DOM manipulation


## ðŸš€ How It Works
- User opens the page in a browser.
  - The table displays only the header: "2023 Movie Releases".
- When the header is clicked:
  - A 3-second delay is triggered using setTimeout.
  - After the delay, JavaScript dynamically inserts 10 rows into the table.
  - Each row includes:
    - Movie Title
    - Releade date
    - Genre


## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Event Listeners: Detect user interactions (clicks)
- Callback Functions: Used to delay execution
- DOM Manipulation: Dynamically create and insert HTML elements
- Separation of Concerns: HTML for structure, CSS for design, JS for logic

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
